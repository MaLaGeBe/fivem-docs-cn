Here is a list of some of the functions that you can use specifically in **server** side scripts.

特定运行环境函数
--------------------------
Some functions are exclusive to the scripting runtime you're using, and are **not** documented
in the [FiveM Native Reference List](https://runtime.fivem.net/doc/reference.html). Refer to their docs for more detail.

- [Lua 中的服务器端函数](/docs/scripting-reference/runtimes/lua/server-functions)
- [JavaScript 中的服务器端函数](/docs/scripting-reference/runtimes/javascript/server-functions)
- [C# 中的服务器端函数](/docs/scripting-reference/runtimes/csharp/server-functions)

原生函数
----------------
These are native functions provided by the Citizen framework. Clicking each link will lead to the FiveM native
reference, where you can see syntax per language, a description, and examples for using the native.

These natives are usable in **all** runtimes.
